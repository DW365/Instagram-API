## Steps for creating good issues or pull requests.

**Pull requests are highly welcome** but (*please read below*)

I might never be able merge some pull requests because of code maintenance issue,  
I try very hard to make this repo an exact replica of the [PHP](https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API) side from the 

- The project name :) 
- Variable names 
- Folder structure (every *.php file has its *.py sister)
- Class names and Order of functions in a class
- Funtion/Method signature
- Package names

- ** the project doesn't follow PEP standards if it will take out similarity**

this makes the php wiki 100% applicable. 

this has been achieved by bringing changes to this side in the same order of commits as they are made on the php side.

For example,  
At the time of updating this guidelines, this project is believed (by me :) ) to be ~exactly similar to the php project at this [commit](https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API/commit/7c37130890287287b0d2a6823cfbd9caffaf2a03),
that is this [commit](https://github.com/danleyb2/Instagram-API/commit/be1d4357d896af9581c1be96a74136eebc12667a) on this project. (try opening the above commits in two new tabs and compare)


So if your PR is about a change that is already on the **PHP** project but made at a later commit like say [this](https://github.com/mgp25/Instagram-API/commit/c03d72e01425f63ec8386d833fd4410f6aac9c7c),
the maintainers wont be able to **merge** because we believe (it's true :) ) it will be replicated to this side when it's reached and we dont want to get a very hard time then. if you think otherwise, please raise an issue.


**But you are always free to fork and do anything you want to your fork**

Thank you.
